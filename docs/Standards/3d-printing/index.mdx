# 3D Printing

## Quick Material Reference

See Prusa's guide for printing different materials including temperatures, adhesion, and bed type.

## Captive Nuts

## Clearance Holes

:::tip[What's a Clearance Hole?]

A clearance hole is a hole that is slightly larger than the diameter of the screw or bolt
to allow the hardware to pass through without threading.

:::

When designing 3D printed parts with clearance holes, we recommend using a 
loose fit hole (tested with metric hardware). OnShape has built-in support
for making clearance holes without needing to know the exact values for different
fits. 

In the case you want to do it manually, Google a drill chart for metric hardware 
and use the loose fit.

## Self-Tapping Holes

## Heated Threaded Inserts

Heated threaded inserts are used to create strong threaded holes in 3D prints that
will often be threaded/unthreaded.
