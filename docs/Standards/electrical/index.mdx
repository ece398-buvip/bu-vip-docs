# Electrical

Recommended standard electrical components in ECE 398 VIP at Bradley University.

## Connectors

Connectors to use when carrying power between two points.

### Anderson SB-50
*High Power - Wire to Wire*

<img src={img_sb50} width="300" />

- Good for battery connections to high-power sources (up to 50A)
- Typically connects to larger gauge wire with lugs on the end to attach to battery posts
- No soldering

### Anderson PowerPole
*Low-Medium Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={img_powerpole} width="300" />

- Better for small power applications
- Can typically crimp down to 22AWG wire, making it good for communication too
- No soldering

**How to crimp these connectors:**

### Dupont Connectors
*Low Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={img_dupont} width="300" />

### JST-XH Connectors
*Low Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={img_jstxh} width="300" />

### Circular Aviation Connectors
*Low Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={img_aviation} width="300" />

* Good for more rugged environments (outdoors, vibration, etc.)
* More secure connection with threaded locking mechanism
* Requires soldering to attach wires to pins

### RJ45 & CAT6E cable (Ethernet)
*Low Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={img_rj45} width="300" />

* Good for high-speed data transfer

### WAGO Connectors

*Low-Medium Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={wago} width="300" />

* Good for quick, solderless connections
* Works with many different wire gauges
* Great for prototyping and testing

### Screw Terminals

*Low Power / Data - Wire to Board*

<img src={screwterm} width="300" />

* Great for wire-to-board connections (like to a PCB, breadboard, or proto board)

### Terminal Blocks (Din)

*Low-Medium Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={terminalBlocks} width="300" />

* Mounts to a DIN rail for organization
* Modular
* Come in either screw or spring clamp terminals

### Terminal Blocks (Panel Mount)

*Low-Medium Power / Data - Wire to Wire*

<img src={screwTermBlocks} width="300" />

* Mounts to a panel using screw holes

## Microcontrollers

Standard microcontrollers for use in ECE 398 VIP projects. Commonly kept in stock 
in the lab, and recommended for new designs.

### Arduino Uno

<img src={uno} width="300" />

A popular controller based on the ATMega328P microcontroller.

- Easy to prototype
- Lots of libraries and tutorials available
- Not as powerful

| Logic Level | Nominal Clock Speed | WiFi/Bluetooth | SDK | Datasheet |
| ---         | ---                 | ---            | --- | ---       |
| TTL (5V)    | 16MHz               | No             | [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) | [Docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3/) |

### Raspberry Pi Pico

<img src={pico} width="300" />

Relatively new microcontroller based on the RP2024 microcontroller.

- Supports Arduino framework
- More powerful than Arduino Uno
- Supports MicroPython and C/C++
- Smaller package
- Easily integrated with custom PCBs

**Different Variations:**

* [Pico-W](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/raspberry-pi/SC0918/16608263) (Pico Wireless RP2040)
* [Pico](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/raspberry-pi/SC0915/13684020) (Pico RP2040, original version)
* [Pico 2](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/raspberry-pi/SC1631/24627136) (Pico RP2350, newer version)

### ESP32

<img src={esp32} width="300" />

A powerful microcontroller with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.

- Supports Arduino framework
- Useful for projects needing bluetooth or WiFi connectivity
- Faster clock speed than Arduino Uno
- Uses FreeRTOS out of the box
