## Imperial Fasteners

## Framing

Typically, framing is done with 80/20 aluminum extrusion. The most common profile
in stock is the 10-series. For more details, check out the [80/20 website](https://8020.net/).

## Enclosures

In the past, we have used polycase enclosures for projects. Typically, projects
use the WQ series enclosures, which are outdoor rated plastic enclosures typically
with a clear lid. Check out [Polycase](https://polycase.com/) for more details.
