# Safety Guidelines

The following sections recommend design considerations for safety for all students
and staff that may design, build, or interact with projects.

These standards are **mandatory** in projects that participate in any public
showcases outside of the VIP lab.

## General safety guidelines

* Overall, it is a good idea to include fuses in series with sensitive equipment.
* Attempt to design systems to fail in a safe way.
* Any projects using 120VAC or greater than or equal to 24VDC should ensure
all exposed contacts (wires, terminals, etc) are reasonably heat-shrunk or wrapped to
reduce shock hazards.

## Safety Requirements

The following safety features are **required** on your project if it meets
any of the following descriptions.

### Projects require an E-Stop if:

* You have any electro-mechanical system as part of your project.

If your system draws more than that rated 10A of most E-Stops, you must route
the power through a power relay or contactor.

### Projects require a circuit breaker if:

* Your project uses 120VAC power or similar power supply.
* Your project uses greater than or equal to 24VDC power.
