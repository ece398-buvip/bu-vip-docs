# Software

## Git

ECE 398 uses Git, a distributed version control system to manage code and track 
changes. There are a couple tools listed below for its use. You can also check
out this link:

For a tutorial on how branching works. It's a good introduction to git as a version
control system.

# Software

The following are some software stackups that have been used by other projects in the past.

# Language Overview

Different languages and their common use-cases.

## C/C++

<img src={c_cpp} width="200" />

C and C++ are the most common embedded systems and system-level programming languages.
Use C/C++ if your project requires speed and hardware access.

**Good For:**

* Real-time systems
* Embedded systems with lots of external hardware interaction
* Fast processing

**Not Great For:**

* Rapid prototyping
* Tasks where time doesn't matter

### Sample:

**C**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

**C++**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
}
```

## Python

Python is an easy-to-use high-level programming language that runs on an interpreter.
Python does **not** compile to machine code, so it requires extra overhead that C/C++ does not.

**Great For:**

* Rapid prototyping
* Data analysis
* Machine learning
* Scripts

**Not Great For:**

* Performance-critical applications
* Low-level hardware interaction

### Sample

```Python
print("Hello, world!")
```
