VIP uses a set of version control and hosting tools to manage software "repositories" for projects. 
*Repositories* are just collections of files and directories that make up a codebase. Each of these 
tools has an important role in managing code:

**[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** is a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system
that allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without stepping on each other's toes.
Think of it like collaborating on a google doc, except instead of everyone doing it live, you 
have your own copy of the document, which you then edit and merge back into the main document later.

**[GitHub](https://github.com/about)** is a website that hosts Git repositories, and is where we store all of our code. For VIP, we host all our code [here](https://github.com/ece398-buvip).
It's the *Google Drive* for code. Users can copy other peoples code, suggest changes, and many other collaborative tasks.

**[GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)** is a graphical user interface for managing Git repositories. It allows users to commit their changes
to a codebase, and then sync those changes with GitHub. This is the tool that this tutorial teaches you how to install. 
All the other tools are already setup for you by admins.

## Install
